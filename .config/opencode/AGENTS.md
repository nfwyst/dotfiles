I only speak Mandarin, so you must always respond in Chinese.

## Other-requirements

- Always use ultrawork mode.
- After each test command or new process is started, you must ensure that the process is completely cleaned up to prevent residual processes from affecting system stability and subsequent operations.
- Before starting a new process, you must first check and ensure that no identical process or service is already running to avoid resource conflicts and waste. This is particularly important when combined with the parallel capabilities of ultrawork, which should intelligently coordinate resources to ensure efficient and conflict-free execution.
